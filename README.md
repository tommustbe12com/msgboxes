# msgboxes
Simple message box creator built in AutoIt. Note: the width/height function doesn't work yet. Open source

## usage
Made for windows. I'll never make a linux/unix compatible version because I'm too lazy and message boxes like these are kind of Windows' thing.

Just open the exe and fill in the text boxes. Again, the width and height function doesn't work yet.
## What to expect
A message box. Normal windows one. Enhanced DPI compared to default AutoIt.

## Giving credit
No credit needed. Just use it.
